                The men of Earth came to Mars.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;They came because they were afraid or unafraid, because they were happy or
                unhappy, because they felt like Pilgrims or did not feel like Pilgrims. There was
                a reason for each man. They were leaving bad wives or bad jobs or bad towns;
                they were coming to find something or leave something or get something, to dig
                up something or bury something or leave something alone. They were coming
                with small dreams or large dreams or none at all. But a government finger
                pointed from four-color posters in many towns: THERE'S WORK FOR YOU
                IN THE SKY: SEE MARS! and the men shuffled forward, only a few at first, a
                double-score, for most men felt the great illness in them even before the rocket
                fired into space. And this disease was called The Loneliness, because when you
                saw your home town dwindle the size of your fist and then lemon-size and then
                pin-size and vanish in the fire-wake, you felt you had never been born, there was
                no town, you were nowhere, with space all around, nothing familiar, only other
                strange men. And when the state of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, or Montana
                vanished into cloud seas, and, doubly, when the United States shrank to a misted
                island and the entire planet Earth became a muddy baseball tossed away, then
                you were alone, wandering in the meadows of space, on your way to a place you couldn't imagine.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;So it was not unusual that the first men were few. The number grew steadily
                in proportion to the census of Earth Men already on Mars. There was comfort in
                numbers. But the first Lonely Ones had to stand by themselves.
